I'm trying to build a chrome extension that works on google sheets, tracking sheets
visited on each instance (tab) and allowing the user to switch between the most 
recently visited sheets. The "ui" html is designed to be brought up when the user 
hits "alt+`" (backtick). Then the worksheets can be cycled through the ui (while
still holding "alt") with backtick and left/right/up/down. The menu is then hidden
when "alt" is released. 

I have some listeners set up in the content.js file:
const modifierKey = event.metaKey || event.altKey;

I'd like to use event.altKey for non-MacOS operating systems.

For MacOS, I'd like use command button instead of alt key. However, the "meta" key is triggered on Mac
by hitting Fn+Command. I want to just hit "Cmd+`"

Please don't change full code. Just suggest minor changes to consider unless i ask for full files.

The file structure of the project is:
manifest.json
src/content.js
src/sheet_tracker.js
src/ui/ui.html
src/ui/ui.css
src/ui/ui.js
