I'm trying to build a chrome extension that works on google sheets, tracking sheets
visited on each instance (tab) and allowing the user to switch between the most 
recently visited sheets. The "ui" html is designed to be brought up when the user 
hits "alt+`" (backtick). Then the worksheets can be cycled through the ui (while
still holding "alt") with backtick and left/right/up/down. The menu is then hidden
when "alt" is released. 

For MacOS, I'd like use some other trigger and scrolling keys. I'm open to suggestions.

The file structure of the project is:
manifest.json
src/content.js
src/sheet_tracker.js
src/ui/ui.html
src/ui/ui.css
src/ui/ui.js

Let's discuss changes before you make them. I've uploaded the above files for your review.
