Hello, Gemini -- this is your prompt!

I'm developing a google chrome extension directed at allowing easy sheet switching in
Google Sheets. It is working but I have things I want to knock out to complete the project. 

I'm sharing my files with you. The "tree -f" out put on my project is as follows:

.
├── ./manifest.json
├── ./prompt.txt
└── ./src
    ├── ./src/content.js
    ├── ./src/sheet_tracker.js
    └── ./src/ui
        ├── ./src/ui/ui.css
        ├── ./src/ui/ui.html
        └── ./src/ui/ui.js

3 directories, 7 files

Remaining development and ideas
===============================

3. Upload to github. Need to set up a project there and push my local git to it.
4. I need to pack the extension.
